# NumberGuessingGame

Project: Guessing Game

Create a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number,
and the player has to guess it within a certain number of attempts.

Random Number Generation:
Use the random number generation library in C++ (e.g., rand())  to generate a random number.

Game Loop:
Implement a game loop that allows the player to make multiple guesses until they either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.


Player Input:
Prompt the player to enter their guess and capture their input.
Validate the input to ensure it is a valid integer within the desired range.


Compare Guess with Target Number:
Compare the player's guess with the randomly generated target number.
Provide feedback to the player (e.g., "Too high!" or "Too low!") based on the comparison.

Attempt Tracking:
Keep track of the number of attempts the player has made.
Display the remaining attempts to the player.

Win/Lose Conditions:
If the player guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, display a winning message and end the game.
If the player runs out of attempts without guessing the correct number, display a losing message and end the game.

Replay Option:
Give the player the option to play again once the game is over.
If the player chooses to play again, reset the game and generate a new random number.
